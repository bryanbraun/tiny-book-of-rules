# Debugging Rules configuration

Rules is to a great tool for automation configured in a point-and-click web interface. Just as when automating things with code, you will
be happy for a debugger every once in a while. The Rules debugger is found at the Rules configuration page â€“ you will want to write out the debug messages directly on the web pages to easily follow what rules are executed, what conditions are evaluated TRUE or FALSE, and how long time each step takes.

If variables are not behaving as you expect, you will find the Rules action **Debug value** useful (provided by the Devel module). It prints out a krumo dump of a variable that you choose, making it available for inspection.
